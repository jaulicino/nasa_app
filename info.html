  When I first looked at the question, "Why do you want to work for NASA?", I thought back to childhood memories and powerful emotional moments which set me on the path of applying today. But after further consideration, I realized that this question is intentionally widely open-ended and the reasons I have for applying are not just emotional. I am intellectually fascinated by NASA's work and believe that I have the scientific acumen to assist NASA as an intern. 
<br><br>
  I decided that I needed to demonstrate this and believe I have done so here. I decided to do a project of such type for three reasons:<br>
  	1) It demonstrates my drive and work ethic: hopefully I have shown I am dedicating and willing to go above and beyond <br>
  	2) It demonstrates my knowledge of implementing scientific disciplines and phenomena into code and <br>computational environments<br>
  	3) It demonstrates my ability to self motivate, and work through problems I encounter. Hopefully, it <br>demonstrates I have the mind of a NASA scientist<br>
<br><br>
  The technological specifics and techniques I used are below:<br>
  	1) Recursive and Algorithmic programming: the fill method in building the planets<br>
  	2) Physics: Newtonian Gravitation, time scale millions of times sped up (would be boring otherwise!)<br>
  	3) Mass: Mass's are calculated based on the sun's average density (for the star) and the earth's <br>average density (for the earth). The dotted lines showing respective radii are accurate<br>
  	4) Images, UI's Etc: Credit for planet/sun images to NASA, everything else was designed by me<br>
<br><br>
  Granted, this project is certainly not perfect. There are a number of things I would like to fix one day, including:<br>
  	1) Inconsistent use of scales in image size and displacement of planets: originally this was necessary<br> if the viewer wants to see the planets and the sun in the same shot, however I am sure there is a <br>better way<br>
  	2) Imperfect physics: there are no collisions, and smaller bugs I noticed during testing<br>
  	3) Slow UI: design is not my strongest suite, however I believe I could substantially improve on the <br>UI seen here<br>
  	4) Planet physics is based on the tiled drawing, completed when adding the planet. But the image is<br> simply a circle: originally, I implemented an image system based on drawing but this was difficult to <br> see in the solar system map. I am sure there is a better way<br>

    To whomever is reading this, I cannot thank you enough for making it this far in my application and application project, and hope that you will consider me a strong candidate for the position.
